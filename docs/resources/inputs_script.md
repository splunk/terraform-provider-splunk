## Argument Reference
For latest resource argument reference: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTREF/RESTinput#data.2Finputs.2Fscript

This resource block supports the following arguments:
* `name` - (Required) Specify the name of the scripted input.
* `disabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether the input script is disabled.
* `index` - (Optional) Sets the index for events from this input. Defaults to the main index.
* `host` - (Optional) Sets the host for events from this input. Defaults to whatever host sent the event.
* `sourcetype` - (Optional) Sets the sourcetype key/field for events from this input. If unset, Splunk software picks a source type based on various aspects of the data. As a convenience, the chosen string is prepended with 'sourcetype::'. There is no hard-coded default.
                            Sets the sourcetype key initial value. The key is used during parsing/indexing, in particular to set the source type field during indexing. It is also the source type field used at search time.

                        Sets the source key initial value. The key is used during parsing/indexing, in particular to set the source field during indexing. It is also the source field used at search time. As a convenience, the chosen string is prepended with 'source::'.
* `rename_source` - (Optional) Specify a new name for the source field for the script.
* `passauth` - (Optional) User to run the script as. If you provide a username, Splunk software generates an auth token for that user and passes it to the script.
* `interval` - (Optional) Specify an integer or cron schedule. This parameter specifies how often to execute the specified script, in seconds or a valid cron schedule. If you specify a cron schedule, the script is not executed on start-up.
