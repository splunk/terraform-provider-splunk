Copy the full contents of the splunk_httpinput app directory to this directory for the configuration to work. When enabled, only the tokens defined in the splunk_httpinput app in this repository are viewable and editable on the API and the Data Inputs page in Splunk Web. When disabled, the input writes its configuration to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps by default. Defaults to 0 (disabled).
