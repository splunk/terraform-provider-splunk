This resource block supports the following arguments:
* `name` - (Required) <host>:<port> of the Splunk receiver. <host> can be either an ip address or server name. <port> is the that port that the Splunk receiver is listening on.
* `disabled` - (Optional) If true, disables the group.

             The data distribution method used when two or more servers exist in the same forwarder group.
* `ssl_alt_name_to_check` - (Optional) The alternate name to match in the remote server's SSL certificate.

                                          If there is no match, assume that Splunk Enterprise is not authenticated against this server. You must specify this setting if sslVerifyServerCert is true.

* `ssl_verify_server_cert` - (Optional) If true, make sure that the server you are connecting to is a valid one (authenticated). Both the common name and the alternate name of the server are then checked for a match.
