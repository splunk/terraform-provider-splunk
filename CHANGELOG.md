##1.5.0

**WARNING: POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGES**
* Change splunk_indexes field types:
    * bucket_rebuild_memory_hint - Int
    * max_hot_buckets - String
    * rep_factor - Int

These settings must be changed to be of the correct type in the Terraform configuration. They were the incorrect type previously, and as such their values were never updated during state refresh.
